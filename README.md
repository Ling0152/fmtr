### Introduction <img src="man/images/fmtr2.png" align="right" height="138" />

Currently in the middle of revising 
the documentation.  Best source is 
[here](https://fmtr.r-sassy.org/articles/fmtr.html).


### Installation

The **fmtr** package is part of the **[sassy](http://www.r-sassy.org)** 
meta-package.  **fmtr** will install by default if you have installed **sassy**.  

However, if you wish to install the **fmtr** package individually, you
may do so by running the following command from your R console:

    install.packages("fmtr")


Then put the following line at the top of your script:

    library(fmtr)


The **fmtr** package will then be loaded, and available for use in your project.

### Getting Help

If you need help with the **sassy** family of packages, the best place 
to turn to is the [r-sassy](http://www.r-sassy.org) web site.  
This web site offers many examples, and full
documentation on every function.  

If you need additional help, please turn 
to [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).  The stackoverflow 
community will be very willing to answer your questions.  

### Next Steps

Next, you should read the [Get started](http://fmtr.r-sassy.org/articles/fmtr.html)
page, and look at some examples.  These examples will demonstrate the 
extraordinary usefulness of the formatting functions, and give you many ideas
on how and where to use the **fmtr** package.
